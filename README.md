# ABOUT ME:
I'm a Year 12 student, currently studying Maths, Physics, Chemistry and Further Maths A-Level. After taking Computer Science GCSE, I became passionate about programming, and hope to gain a place on a Degree Apprenticeship program to further my learning. After this, I aspire to program robots or make software for machines.
